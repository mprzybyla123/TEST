One of the most difficult facets of machine learning is ingesting text data for your model. When building your model, there are your inputs or features, and then what you are trying to predict. While some types of models can be grouped by either a numerical or categorical predictor or target variable, there is not as much documentation on what to do when you want to use not just numeric, but text as your feature type. Feature transformation is a way to incorporate both types and convert them into a usable format as your X variables to predict your Y predictor or variable. The code below uses sklearn libraries to transform and combine these two types of data into one input.
